# Personal_finances_analysis

This repository has a ipynb file that was used to analyze data from my personal finances, made in a spreadsheet. 
There is further explanation in the file, but in summary, the following was made:
* Data cleaning and analysis of correlation;
* Linear regression using time (index) as input variable;
* Auto regression;

# Data secrecy

Since the financial data that was explored was personal, I followed measures to keep my actual data privated.

Firstly, I considered the following reference: https://mostly.ai/blog/data-anonymization-in-python

But ultimately decided for a practical approach: Copying the original file and filling out fake information.
