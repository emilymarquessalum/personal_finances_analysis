# Personal Finances Analysis

This is V0 of a free and open source application/system/analysis-tool to control your personal finances. It was made to allow for simple usability when dealing with day to day tasks, while at the same time allowing deeper and more complex use for planning for the future and understanding your spending patterns, and keeping track of several different things in your personal life that can impact your financial life. In here, you can check the [list of features and their recommended order of use](). 
I will use [penpot](https://penpot.app) to create the designs.
